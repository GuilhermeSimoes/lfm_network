# Last.fm Network

A javascript project to visualize a user's Last.fm network. Technologies used include:

* Last.fm API
* Javascript (jQuery + d3.js + HTML5 history API)
* HTML + CSS
* Ruby on Rails

Wish I had more time to finish this. In the meantime, try it out [here](http://lastfm-network.herokuapp.com/)!

## How to run

First, install all the required gems with:

    bundle install

Then follow the instructions on the file `application.template.yml` located in the `config` directory.

Finally, start a web server on port 3000 with:

    rails server
